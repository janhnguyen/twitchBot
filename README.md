# twitchBot

Reads Twitch Chat messages. Requires a 2800x1880 resolution screenshot and precise settings. Records word frequency so that I can turn my Twitch Chat into a permanent game of pictionary.

Implemented in such a way that the output is only achieveable once the program terminates.
```
pip install pytesseract opencv-python pillow pyautogui
