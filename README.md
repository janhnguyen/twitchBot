# Twitch Chat Reader

A simple project that uses Computer Vision to read twitch chat messages and record word frequency. The main purpose of this program is to use the word frequency to turn the most commonly used words into 7tv emotes.

Requires a 2800x1880 resolution screenshot and precise accessibility settings. It is recommended to run this alongside a browser that does not have the 7tv extension.

Implemented in such a way that the output is only achieveable once the program terminates.
